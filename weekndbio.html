                    <p class="text justify-paragraph-bio">Born in Toronto in 1990 to Ethiopian immigrants, Tesfaye was raised by his mother
                        and
                        grandmother in Scarborough. He is fluent in Amharic and French. He dropped out of school at
                        seventeen, adopting his stage name "The Weeknd" after leaving home one weekend (removing the 'e'
                        to
                        avoid trademark issues). His early experiences with homelessness, incarceration, and drug use
                        significantly influenced his music.</p>

                    <h2 class="biosubheadings">Breakthrough</h2>
                    <p class="text justify-paragraph-bio">Tesfaye began releasing music anonymously on YouTube in 2009, collaborating with
                        producer Jeremy Rose. His identity was initially undisclosed, gaining wider attention after
                        being acknowledged by Drake. In 2011, he co-founded the XO record label and released three
                        mixtapes—House of Balloons, Thursday, and Echoes of Silence—which established his distinctive
                        alternative R&B sound.</p>

                    <h2 class="biosubheadings">Evolution</h2>
                    <p class="text justify-paragraph-bio">He signed with Republic Records, reissuing his early mixtapes as Trilogy in 2012,
                        followed by his debut studio album, Kiss Land, in 2013. His career then shifted towards a more
                        pop-oriented sound with albums like Beauty Behind the Madness (2015) and Starboy (2016), both of
                        which reached number one on the US Billboard 200 and produced multiple chart-topping singles. He
                        returned to alternative R&B with My Dear Melancholy (2018) and later explored dream pop and new
                        wave with After Hours (2020), which featured the record-breaking single "Blinding Lights."</p>

                    <h2 class="biosubheadings">Influence</h2>

                        (2025). He also made a controversial acting debut in The Idol (2023). The Weeknd has achieved
                        significant commercial success, selling over 75 million records, earning numerous diamond
                        certifications, and setting records for Spotify streams, establishing him as one of the world's
                        best-selling artists and an influential figure in music.</p>
